Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Without well-written paragraphs that flow logically from one idea to the next and that inform and help support understanding of the research problem being investigated, your paper will not be viewed as credible by the reader. More than simply a collection of sentences, a paragraph must possess a controlling idea [i.e., the thinking strategy, opinion, or attitude that provides a framework from which to interpret the authorâ€™s position concerning the research problem]. The paragraph should then explain the idea in a structurally coherent way and be sufficiently developed to inform the reader about that idea in a way that transitions naturally into the next paragraph or section of your paper.
